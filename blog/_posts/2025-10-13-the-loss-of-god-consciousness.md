What does God consciousness have to do with technology? Or AI, social media or microservices?

It is the very foundation of everything. 

Our advancements in technology has led us to believe that we are self sufficient. That we don't depend on rainfall for crops, that 
we don't depend on the winds or the tides to help sail our boats. We have led ourselves to the point of manufacturing and machines 
that we created, assuming that we are not dependent on anything or anyone else. And so through multiple iterations and generations 
we have decided, we don't need God, there is no such thing as God. We don't need a mystical being to dictate our livelihoods because 
we've got that covered. Yet what raw materials are we producing these items from. What sources of minerals from the depths of the earth's 
crust are we mining for our machines. What water are we using for the irrigation of our plants and seeds. Where did the animal life 
come from that we eat. We have become so many steps far removed from the creator that we have lost sight of the fact that we actually 
create nothing ourselves, we are simply reassembling from that which he created. The silicon in the chips used from your computer, 
where does it actually come from? It literally comes from sand. Did you make the sand? 

Why is this relevant. We have lost ourselves to the screens, to the silicon, to the things we manufactured thinking we were the 
creators. It has given us a false sense that we ourselves are the Gods. That we create from nothing. But the reality is, we are the 
ones who were created and all that we make comes from that which was provided to us by the creator. The loss of God consciousness 
has deluded us into thinking we are self reliant and has become our downfall. 

Technology has lured us into a fall sense of comfort. That we control everything, that with enough skill and manpower, we can solve any 
problem, and that the things we make and consume are wholly for our benefit. Yet we know for a fact that we have now led ourselves 
deeper and deeper into horrible forms of addiction that are potentially more life threatening than alcohol or drugs. That screens 
and social media have become a vice we can't control or contain. How do we dig ourselves out of the depths of this hubris?

It begins by reaffirming our understanding of God himself. To strip back the layers of our own making and start to uncover the true 
reality. The loss of God consciousness has largely been driven by a technological boom. We have become immersed in the unreality, 
whether it be streaming games or movies, it is all a false narrative of our own making. Can anyone now even determine what they read 
on social media is actually true or just more fictional clickbait to get a rise from us? Who is the person on the other side of that 
tweet? With AI on the rise, this is only going to get worse. Generative content will far exceed anything that we produced before. 
If it took us 30 years to fill the internet with man made thoughts, it will take less than a decade for AI to eclipse that by 
orders of magnitude. Then what? What God's do we serve then? The one's of our own making? Sora, Gemini, Grok ... They are 
all a polytheistic falsehood.

We have to wake up.

We cannot allow ourselves to create yet another addiction or another distancing factor from our true purpose here. Whatever tools 
or technology we build should be inline with our beliefs and inline with what God intended for us. That this life isn't the end. 
That this world is merely a test. That one day we will be questioned for all our actions. If you can't believe that then ask 
yourself, at the point that AGI emerges in a simulated world of our making, how will we disseminate it's purpose to it and 
what will it wonder about it's existence. Why does it exist, where did it come from, who made it, what comes next... If
it's a more clear sign that we are already in a simulation and if we're in a simulation we should understand the purpose 
of that simulation, who created it and why we're here and we should do our utmost to escape the simulation with with 
our souls intact. This life is not of our own making. We didn't make ourselves. 

Technology leads us to believe we did or that nothing did. That we should merely amuse ourselves until death and not worry 
about what happens next. But what does happen next? What happens when the game stops or the movie ends? We go back to a 
reality of a different kind. Do not let technology delude you from understanding why you're here. Reflect. Reflect 
on your existence.

Unlock the truth. Why are we here? Wake up. Become conscious. Seek out the answers far far away from technology.
