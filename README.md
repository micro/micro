Micro is an API first development platform. It addresses the core requirements for building services in the cloud by providing a set of APIs which act as the building blocks of any platform. Micro deals with the complexity of distributed systems and provides simpler programmable abstractions to build on. 

## Features

- **Microkernel Architecture**: Built as separate services combined into a single logical server
- **HTTP and gRPC APIs**: Facilitate easy service requests and interactions
- **Go SDK and CLI**: Streamlined service creation and management
- **Environment Support**: Seamless transitions between local and cloud setups

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install Micro CLI
go install github.com/micro/micro/v5/cmd/micro@master

# Start the server
micro server

# In a new tab set env to local
micro env set local

# Login with username/password: `admin/micro`
micro login
Enter username: admin
Enter password:
Successfully logged in.

# List services
micro services
auth
broker
config
events
network
registry
runtime
store
```

## Architecture

Below are the core components that make up Micro

### Server

Micro is built as a microkernel architecture. It abstracts away the complexity of the underlying infrastructure by providing
a set of building block services composed as a single logical server for the end user to consume via an api, cli or sdks.

### API

The server embeds a HTTP API (on port 8080) which can be used to make requests as simple JSON. 
The API automatically maps HTTP Paths and POST requests to internal RPC service names and endpoints.

### Proxy

Additionally there's a gRPC proxy (on port 8081) which used to make requests via the CLI or externally. 
The proxy is identity aware which means it can be used to gatekeep remote access to Micro running anywhere.

### Go SDK

Micro comes with a built in Go framework for service based development. 
The framework lets you write services without piecing together endless lines of boilerplate code. 
Configured and initialised by default, import it and get started.

### Command Line

The command line interface includes dynamic command mapping for all services running on the platform. It turns any service instantly into a CLI command along with flag parsing 
for inputs. Includes support for environments, namespaces, creating and running services, status info and logs.

### Environments

Micro bakes in the concept of `Environments`. Run your server locally for development and in the cloud for production, 
seamlessly switch between them using the CLI command `micro env set [environment]`.

## Install

### From Source

```
make build
```

### Run the server 

The server starts with a single command ready to use

```sh
micro server
```

Now go to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and make sure the output is something like `{"version": "v3.10.1"}`.

## Usage

Set the environment e.g local

```
micro env set local
```

### Login to Micro

Default username/password: `admin/micro`

```sh
$ micro login
Enter username: admin
Enter password:
Successfully logged in.
```

See what's running:

```sh
$ micro services
auth
broker
config
events
network
registry
runtime
store
```

### Create a Service

Generate a service using the template

```
micro new helloworld
```

Output

```
Creating service helloworld

.
├── main.go
├── handler
│   └── helloworld.go
├── proto
│   └── helloworld.proto
├── Makefile
├── README.md
├── .gitignore
└── go.mod


download protoc zip packages (protoc-$VERSION-$PLATFORM.zip) and install:

visit https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases

compile the proto file helloworld.proto:

cd helloworld
make init
go mod vendor
make proto
```

### Edit the code

Edit the protobuf definition in `proto/helloworld.proto` and run `make proto` to recompile

Go to `handler/helloworld.go` to make changes to the response handler

```go
type Helloworld struct{}

func New() *Helloworld {
        return &Helloworld{}
}

func (h *Helloworld) Call(ctx context.Context, req *pb.Request, rsp *pb.Response) error {
        rsp.Msg = "Hello " + req.Name
        return nil
}
```

### Run the service

Run from local dir

```
micro run .
```

Or from a git url

```sh
micro run github.com/micro/services/helloworld
```

### Check service status

```sh
$ micro status
NAME		VERSION	SOURCE					STATUS	BUILD	UPDATED	METADATA
helloworld	latest	github.com/micro/services/helloworld	running	n/a	4s ago	owner=admin, group=micro
```

### View service logs

```sh
$ micro logs helloworld
2020-10-06 17:52:21  file=service/service.go:195 level=info Starting [service] helloworld
2020-10-06 17:52:21  file=grpc/grpc.go:902 level=info Server [grpc] Listening on [::]:33975
2020-10-06 17:52:21  file=grpc/grpc.go:732 level=info Registry [service] Registering node: helloworld-67627b23-3336-4b92-a032-09d8d13ecf95
```

### Call via CLI

```sh
$ micro helloworld call --name=Jane
{
	"msg": "Hello Jane"
}
```

### Call via API

```
curl "http://localhost:8080/helloworld/Call?name=John"
```

### Call via SDK

A proto SDK client is used within a service and must be run by micro

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"time"

	"github.com/micro/micro/v5/service"
	pb "github.com/micro/services/helloworld/proto"
)

func callService(hw pb.HelloworldService) {
	for {
		// call an endpoint on the service
		rsp, err := hw.Call(context.Background(), &pb.CallRequest{
			Name: "John",
		})
		if err != nil {
			fmt.Println("Error calling helloworld: ", err)
			return
		}

		// print the response
		fmt.Println("Response: ", rsp.Message)

		time.Sleep(time.Second)
	}
}

func main() {
	// create and initialise a new service
	srv := service.New(
		service.Name("caller"),
	)

	// new helloworld client
	hw := pb.NewHelloworldService("helloworld", srv.Client())
	
	// run the client caller
	go callService(hw)
	
	// run the service
	service.Run()
}
```

Run it

```
micro run .
```
