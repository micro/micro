Micro is a toolkit for cloud-native development. It helps you build future-proof application platforms and services.

# Overview

Micro addresses the key requirements for building cloud-native systems. It takes the microservice architecture pattern and transforms it into 
a set of tools which act as the building blocks for scalable platforms. Micro deals with the complexity of distributed systems and provides 
simple abstractions already understood by developers.
