Micro is a toolkit for cloud-native development. It helps you build future-proof application platforms and services.

# Overview

Micro addresses the key requirements for building cloud-native systems. It takes the microservice architecture pattern and transforms it into 
a set of tools which act as the building blocks for scalable platforms. Micro deals with the complexity of distributed systems and provides 
simple abstractions already understood by developers.

Technology is constantly evolving. The infrastructure stack is always changing. Micro is a pluggable toolkit which addresses these issues. 
Plug in any stack or underlying technology. Build future-proof systems using micro.

## Features

The toolkit is composed of the following features:

- [**`api`**](https://github.com/micro/micro/tree/master/api) - API Gateway. A single entry point with dynamic routing using service discovery.
