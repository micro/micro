Micro is a platform for microservices development. 

After many years of working on various platforms at different companies, it became clear 
there was no open source alternative to the types of tooling we saw emerge within large tech companies. 
With that in mind we set out to build a new set of tools for microservices.

In January 2015 we open sourced the [Go Micro](https://go-micro.dev) framework. And following on from that 
the [Micro](https://github.com/micro/micro) toolkit. Micro and Go Micro codify a set of design patterns for service 
development including service discovery, client/server rpc and pubsub messaging. Utilizing a powerful pluggable architecture, 
Micro adapts to any infrastructure while maintaining the same tools and development patterns.

Today we're working on a consumer frontend that focuses on providing a place that can leverage and utilise the tools we've built prior.
