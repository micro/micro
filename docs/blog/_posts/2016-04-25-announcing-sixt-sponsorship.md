Today we're excited to announce [**Sixt**](https://www.sixt.com/) as a sponsor of [**Micro**](https://m3o.com).

Sixt is a European car rental company in over 100 countries and the leader in Germany,
Austria and Switzerland. They have successfully built a business with a legacy of over 100 years, continually
evolving with the rapid pace of change in the world by using latest technologies and achieving clear customer benefits.

With a vision to own the mobility space Sixt recognises the need to leverage bleeding edge technology in this new era.
According to Jochen Werling (CIO) “Microservices are a key element of Sixt future architecture due to their advantages in terms of speed of execution,
agility and worldwide scalability of Sixt’s various services”. By utilising Micro at the core of their
platform, Sixt looks to transform themselves into an innovation leader in the mobility industry.

The sponsorship ensures the long term development of Micro and provides a path to adoption in the enterprise.
Look to hear more from Sixt on their use of Micro in the near future.
