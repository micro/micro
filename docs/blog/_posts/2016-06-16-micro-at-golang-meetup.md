Last night I spoke about Micro at the Go meetup in London. Thanks to everyone that came to the meetup, the organisers 
and all those that asked questions. 

It was mostly a high level overview of the origin of Micro, how it all works and where things are going. It's clear 
from the positive feedback and conversations that there's a lot of interest in adopting microservices. People are trying 
to figure out what the best path is for them. There's no one size fits all. Micro really helps in that regard with 
it's pluggable architecture.
