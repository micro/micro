Hey, we're starting a newsletter! Micro provides an opinionated view on how to build cloud-native systems but we want to provide 
opinions beyond the micro ecosystem too.

[The micro newsletter](https://m3o.com/#newsletter) is an opinionated summary of all things cloud-native. Every so often we'll send out an email with a few 
links to the most interesting cloud-native related content. This may include news, articles, videos, etc.

We'll also share some of our opinions on each piece of content so you can through the noise and get some concise thoughts 
to help you understand what's going on.

We've already sent out two newsletters and the response has been very positive so far. While we started with the idea of a weekly newsletter, 
we'll likely only send you content when there's something interesting to talk about.

[Subscribe](https://m3o.com/#newsletter) if you're interested in hearing from us.
