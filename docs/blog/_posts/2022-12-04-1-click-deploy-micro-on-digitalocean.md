Micro is an API first development platform. It’s a single solution for building API first products from source to running and beyond. Micro abstracts away the complexity of cloud infrastructure and provides simpler building blocks to build on. It embraces the microservices architecture and enables developing a single API as many separate services.

Micro has been in active development since 2015. Much of the cloud infrastructure landscape has changed since then but what still remains true is the need for a simple, fast and efficient developer experience. Micro focuses heavily on creating a single unified experience for microservices and API development. Most of that local Dev has happened on laptops or desktop hardware used as the primary device but we’re also seeing the advent of cloud first Dev environments that can be accessed remotely. A cloud first Dev environment implies the ability to provision more resources or quickly spin up and spin down machines for testing. We think there’s room for Micro to play in this space too by shifting some of the local Dev to the cloud.

For that we’re today unveiling the 1 click deployment of a Micro Dev environment on a DigitalOcean Droplet through the DigitalOcean marketplace. This will enable rapid development of microservices and APIs.
