Today I'm excited to announce the [Micro Explorer](https://m3o.com/explore/), a single place to find projects within the micro ecosystem.

### What is the Explorer?

The Micro Explorer is primarily a search engine for micro related projects. GitHub has become the source of truth 
for the majority of developers and serves as a common place to share code, but it's not always easy to find exactly 
what you're looking for.

The Explorer gives us a way to do just that for all things Micro. We're using the GitHub API to find any public repository 
that makes use of the micro libraries and putting them in a single convenient place for the community to explore and use.

Search is just the first feature of Explorer. Watch this space.

### Why do we need an Explorer?

Time and time again questions appear in the community slack in regards to whether there are existing libraries, 
tools or services for specific micro related requirements. 

Why build something when someone else may have already shared it with the world? Micro looks to promote sharing 
and reuse of plugins and microservices.

With that in mind, it became clear that even the simplest of aggregation tools to surface these repositories would 
be immensely useful.

As the community grows we hope to see more contributed back and made easily accessible through the Micro Explorer.
