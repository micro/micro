Micro is an open source platform for cloud native application development.

## Overview

Micro addresses the key requirements for building services in the cloud. It leverages the microservices
architecture pattern and provides a set of services which act as the building blocks of a platform. Micro deals
with the complexity of distributed systems and provides simpler programmable abstractions to build on. 

Micro provides a logical server composed of building block services, a Go framework for development, command 
line interface, API gateway and gRPC Proxy for external and remote access. Each service provides access 
to underlying infrastructure primitives through a standard interface with a development model tying everything 
together.
